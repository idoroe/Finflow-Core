# Performance Notes

## Baseline Measurements

_Fill in after running the pipeline for the first time._

| Metric | Duration |
|--------|----------|
| Total pipeline runtime | _TBD_ |
| RAW data load | _TBD_ |
| RAW → ANALYTICS transform | _TBD_ |
| Demo Query 1 (Monthly volume) | _TBD_ |
| Demo Query 2 (Top accounts) | _TBD_ |
| Demo Query 3 (By region) | _TBD_ |

## Optimization Applied

_Describe what you changed and why._

**Example**: Added a clustering key on `FCT_TRANSACTIONS(TRANSACTION_DATE)` to improve date-range query pruning.

## After Optimization

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Query 1 | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ |
| Query 2 | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ |
| Query 3 | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ |
